  <h2>Oh, Hello There</h2>
  <p>Looks like you stumpled upon my little app! 
      It doesn't do much, just a quick app I put together to make it easy to track lots of objectives on a Fortnite map.
  </p>

  <p>
      Just click anywhere, and you'll get a litte marker. Click it again to make it disappear!
  </p>

  <p> Quick shout out to IGN's map that I yoinked for this. It's really cool and you should check it out! It has waaaay more info than this ol' thing.</p>
